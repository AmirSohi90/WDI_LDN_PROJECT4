# GA WDI-32 Project - Shwap

What can cause a lot of issues within the workplace, especially ones that rely on shifts, is the admin behind it; organising shifts, employees having a place to see when they're working and if employees need to change shifts everyone who needs to be involved knows.

I decided to make an in-house web-app for a business that enables employers to create shifts for their employees and for somewhere where the employees can see their shifts and request to make changes if they need to. All in one location.

The Vince Grid is a MERN stack application which implements WebSockets for the live draft client, JWT/bcrypt authentication. The app is tested with mocha, chai and enzyme.
